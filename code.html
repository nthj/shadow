title: Shadow &mdash; AWS/S3 Photo Processing for Above Photography
---

<h3>Specifying thumbnail dimensions</h3>

<p>
	Above Photography wanted to be able to easily create different-sized thumbnails in the future.
	A custom language allows us to easily set up new sizes, set options, and specify the name:
</p>

{% highlight ruby %}
Original.find(key).compress(70).resize(270, 167).to(:fit).watermark.save(:medium)
{% endhighlight %}

<h3>Optimizing photo processing speed</h3>

<p>
	Heroku, our web host, allows us to process up to 50 photos at a time.
	At first, Shadow took about 30 seconds to process each photo, 
	but just a few easy changes allowed us to cut this in half &mdash; 
	we&#8217;re now processing over <strong>11,000 photos per hour</strong>.

<h3>Sending to Google Maps</h3>
